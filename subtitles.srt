1
00:00:01, 200 --> 00:00:03, 010
Previously on white collar

2
00:00:03, 120 --> 00:00:05, 760
Why would neal run with three
months left on a four-year sentence? 

3
00:00:05, 820 --> 00:00:06, 760
Well, that's what we're wondering.

4
00:00:06, 800 --> 00:00:11, 360
We're not gonna catch caffrey using
roadblocks and... Wanted posters.

5
00:00:11, 410 --> 00:00:16, 360
Kate says "adios" to you at prison and
gets busy with her disappearing act.

6
00:00:16, 410 --> 00:00:18, 070
Missed her by two days.

7
00:00:18, 120 --> 00:00:19, 950
You can get me out of here.

8
00:00:19, 990 --> 00:00:21, 100
There's case law.

9
00:00:21, 140 --> 00:00:22, 740
I can be released into your custody.

10
00:00:22, 790 --> 00:00:24, 650
Gps tracking anklet.

11
00:00:24, 750 --> 00:00:26, 700
The new ones are
tamper-proof, never been skipped on.

12
00:00:26, 760 --> 00:00:28, 480
let me see it.

13
00:00:30, 750 --> 00:00:32, 960
The forgeries you caught
me on, i signed them.

14
00:00:33, 010 --> 00:00:33, 820
Where? 

15
00:00:33, 870 --> 00:00:36, 320
Look at the bank seal under
polarized light sometime.

16
00:00:36, 390 --> 00:00:41, 160
Apparently, if a tree falls in
a forest, it does make a sound.

17
00:00:41, 220 --> 00:00:42, 760
I may lose her again, moz.

18
00:00:42, 800 --> 00:00:44, 800
Lose her? I just found her.

19
00:00:44, 840 --> 00:00:45, 810
So did he.

20
00:00:45, 860 --> 00:00:47, 520
Kate! Kate! ! 

21
00:00:47, 580 --> 00:00:48, 860
So you know who has kate? 

22
00:00:48, 900 --> 00:00:53, 230
I don't have a name, but
i know this -- he's fbi.

23
00:01:05, 880 --> 00:01:08, 270
So, the guy who has kate is in the fbi? 

24
00:01:08, 360 --> 00:01:09, 290
Apparently.

25
00:01:09, 350 --> 00:01:10, 840
This confirms everything.

26
00:01:10, 940 --> 00:01:12, 160
Moz, take it easy.

27
00:01:12, 220 --> 00:01:14, 380
If you lay down with
dogs, you get up with fleas.

28
00:01:14, 450 --> 00:01:16, 790
I could live without the
fortune-cookie commentary.

29
00:01:16, 940 --> 00:01:20, 120
Now you understand my fear of "the man.

30
00:01:20, 180 --> 00:01:21, 650
" you're back with us, my friend.

31
00:01:21, 710 --> 00:01:24, 370
The fearful masses
-- welcome back.

32
00:01:24, 690 --> 00:01:25, 690
Suspects? 

33
00:01:25, 760 --> 00:01:27, 690
How many field offices
does the fbi have? 

34
00:01:27, 760 --> 00:01:30, 310
56 -- not including
resident agencies.

35
00:01:30, 370 --> 00:01:31, 710
Then i have a lot of suspects.

36
00:01:31, 740 --> 00:01:33, 010
So how do we draw them out? 

37
00:01:33, 070 --> 00:01:35, 380
We don't.It's his move.

38
00:01:38, 380 --> 00:01:39, 350
Morning, peter.

39
00:01:39, 460 --> 00:01:40, 540
Where are you? 

40
00:01:40, 650 --> 00:01:42, 840
Well, within my two-mile
radius.Where are you? 

41
00:01:42, 910 --> 00:01:44, 760
I'm at my dining-room table.

42
00:01:44, 820 --> 00:01:47, 600
Listen.We've got a
suspected jewelry heist.

43
00:01:47, 670 --> 00:01:48, 890
I'm intrigued.

44
00:01:48, 950 --> 00:01:51, 360
Meet me at 14th and 9th in 30.

45
00:01:51, 640 --> 00:01:53, 980
that's le joyau prieux.I'm
even more intrigued.

46
00:01:54, 060 --> 00:01:56, 680
The most expensive clothing
boutique in the city.

47
00:01:56, 740 --> 00:01:58, 490
Of course you'd know it.

48
00:01:58, 550 --> 00:02:00, 390
You're gonna love this.

49
00:02:01, 180 --> 00:02:02, 330
So, what do i do? 

50
00:02:02, 400 --> 00:02:03, 390
Nothing.

51
00:02:03, 420 --> 00:02:05, 200
How about you? 

52
00:02:05, 260 --> 00:02:07, 380
I suffer through another day of work.

53
00:02:08, 940 --> 00:02:11, 320
And eat breakfast alone.

54
00:02:12, 610 --> 00:02:15, 080
So, what happened at le joyau? 

55
00:02:15, 140 --> 00:02:18, 350
Don't know yet.They called this morning
and were a little light on the details.

56
00:02:18, 440 --> 00:02:20, 500
They may or may not have been robbed.

57
00:02:20, 580 --> 00:02:22, 730
So, they called the fbi, not the police? 

58
00:02:22, 790 --> 00:02:24, 860
Must be my dazzling reputation.

59
00:02:24, 950 --> 00:02:28, 080
I don't know what could be so
valuable at a clothing store.

60
00:02:28, 160 --> 00:02:30, 800
Well, hopefully, it has nothing
to do with the promotion.

61
00:02:30, 850 --> 00:02:31, 980
What promotion? 

62
00:02:32, 050 --> 00:02:35, 470
They're displaying the world's
most exotic pink diamond.

63
00:02:35, 730 --> 00:02:37, 950
That might have something to do with it.

64
00:02:46, 050 --> 00:02:49, 340
Well, this is something you don't see
every day, except maybe if you're you.

65
00:02:49, 600 --> 00:02:51, 450
Agent peter burke.

66
00:02:53, 770 --> 00:02:55, 460
It's like buckingham palace.

67
00:02:55, 560 --> 00:02:57, 390
No, i've been to buckingham palace.

68
00:02:57, 500 --> 00:02:58, 900
This is better.

69
00:02:58, 950 --> 00:03:00, 410
- Agent burke? 
- Yeah.

70
00:03:00, 700 --> 00:03:02, 660
This is a delicate situation.

71
00:03:02, 720 --> 00:03:05, 300
I'd appreciate if we
could keep this discreet? 

72
00:03:05, 380 --> 00:03:06, 640
Keep what discreet? 

73
00:03:06, 680 --> 00:03:08, 150
You were a little vague
on your telephone call.

74
00:03:08, 200 --> 00:03:10, 160
You're aware of this promotion? 

75
00:03:10, 800 --> 00:03:14, 160
A display of the most exotic
pink diamond in the world.

76
00:03:14, 510 --> 00:03:16, 950
42-karat steinmetz
pink set in platinum.

77
00:03:16, 970 --> 00:03:18, 670
It may have been stolen.

78
00:03:18, 750 --> 00:03:20, 150
- You're worried it's a forgery? 
- Yes.

79
00:03:20, 210 --> 00:03:21, 390
What makes you think it's a fake? 

80
00:03:21, 580 --> 00:03:23, 230
Follow me, please.

81
00:03:31, 360 --> 00:03:34, 660
When i arrived this
morning, everything was as it should be.

82
00:03:34, 830 --> 00:03:38, 550
We removed the necklace from the
vault, opened the show as planned.

83
00:03:38, 620 --> 00:03:44, 070
Later, when we were doing our mandatory review
of last night's security tapes, we saw this.

84
00:03:44, 270 --> 00:03:46, 020
saw what? 

85
00:03:46, 590 --> 00:03:47, 420
that's your vault? 

86
00:03:47, 490 --> 00:03:51, 570
Yes.The necklace was stored there for
10 hours between its arrival last night

87
00:03:51, 660 --> 00:03:53, 870
and the opening of
the show this morning.

88
00:03:58, 230 --> 00:04:00, 330
That's your first clue? 

89
00:04:00, 770 --> 00:04:02, 230
Why is the necklace still on the model? 

90
00:04:02, 300 --> 00:04:05, 480
It's opening day.This is the
promotional event of the year.

91
00:04:05, 580 --> 00:04:06, 480
I don't care what it is.

92
00:04:06, 520 --> 00:04:08, 350
You've got a masked
man entering your vault.

93
00:04:08, 430 --> 00:04:10, 330
I'm shutting you down.

94
00:04:17, 780 --> 00:04:19, 540
Let's go, folks! The store is closed! 

95
00:04:19, 590 --> 00:04:21, 260
There's nothing to see here.

96
00:04:21, 270 --> 00:04:22, 860
What's going on? 

97
00:04:22, 970 --> 00:04:25, 420
You just became a very
beautiful crime scene.

98
00:04:35, 350 --> 00:04:37, 620
White.Collar.- Season 01 - Episode 07

99
00:04:40, 950 --> 00:04:43, 870
Lauren, have all the models
wait over there.Nobody leaves.

100
00:04:43, 940 --> 00:04:44, 840
Okay.

101
00:04:44, 880 --> 00:04:49, 230
We're not positive it's a counterfeit.Our
appraiser is still on a plane.

102
00:04:49, 340 --> 00:04:51, 950
If it turns out to be a mistake, the
amount of money we would lose, 

103
00:04:51, 970 --> 00:04:55, 130
- not to mention our credibility, would be
- i've got my own appraiser.

104
00:04:57, 050 --> 00:05:00, 830
Hello again.just... 

105
00:05:11, 700 --> 00:05:12, 880
Is it fake? 

106
00:05:12, 930 --> 00:05:15, 020
He's talking about the necklace, right? 

107
00:05:15, 330 --> 00:05:17, 480
It's beautiful work.

108
00:05:17, 580 --> 00:05:18, 960
Thank you.

109
00:05:19, 060 --> 00:05:20, 790
Guess that answers that question.

110
00:05:20, 890 --> 00:05:22, 500
- I need a closer look.
- Just take it off her.

111
00:05:22, 530 --> 00:05:24, 480
I'm trying to preserve the crime scene.

112
00:05:24, 520 --> 00:05:26, 660
- It's preserved.
- May i? 

113
00:05:29, 450 --> 00:05:30, 730
Thank you.

114
00:05:42, 780 --> 00:05:44, 000
Yep.

115
00:05:44, 220 --> 00:05:46, 790
It's synthetic.

116
00:05:47, 020 --> 00:05:49, 320
There's no such thing as a
synthetic pink of that size.

117
00:05:49, 400 --> 00:05:50, 850
It simply doesn't exist.

118
00:05:50, 910 --> 00:05:52, 220
Yes, pink is difficult to match.

119
00:05:52, 280 --> 00:05:56, 130
It's only achievable using irradiation, which
creates an extremely fine occlusion within the stone

120
00:05:56, 180 --> 00:06:00, 040
that's virtually impossible to
detect unless you're looking for it.

121
00:06:05, 240 --> 00:06:07, 720
I don't know how this
could have happened.

122
00:06:07, 810 --> 00:06:11, 850
No one knew when the necklace was to arrive
or where it was supposed to be stored.

123
00:06:11, 960 --> 00:06:14, 770
All right, you two, i'm gonna need
alibis from everyone who worked here

124
00:06:14, 810 --> 00:06:18, 210
and anybody who knew the
diamonds were in the vault.

125
00:06:18, 310 --> 00:06:20, 070
What about our boy with the mask? 

126
00:06:20, 100 --> 00:06:21, 820
Do you have surveillance
on how he got in? 

127
00:06:21, 870 --> 00:06:26, 070
Our security cameras only record what
happens on the floor and in the vault itself.

128
00:06:26, 140 --> 00:06:28, 060
We don't record the hallways.

129
00:06:28, 130 --> 00:06:31, 160
We have a back door, but the
alarm was never triggered.

130
00:06:31, 220 --> 00:06:33, 910
He must have tampered with the system.

131
00:06:33, 960 --> 00:06:35, 660
Do you think he hacked the alarm? 

132
00:06:35, 760 --> 00:06:37, 440
Hacked the alarm? 

133
00:06:37, 540 --> 00:06:40, 490
Oh, yeah, it's possible, if you could find
the camera's blind spots and sneak past.

134
00:06:40, 580 --> 00:06:42, 390
Is that what you'd do? 

135
00:06:42, 490 --> 00:06:44, 330
It's one option.

136
00:06:44, 390 --> 00:06:47, 490
All right, i'm gonna confiscate your
surveillance video, the necklace... 

137
00:06:47, 550 --> 00:06:50, 000
And we will need you
for further questioning.

138
00:06:50, 330 --> 00:06:51, 590
What's it like to be a model? 

139
00:06:51, 640 --> 00:06:53, 390
I bet it's fun. Right? 

140
00:06:53, 550 --> 00:06:55, 710
- You're, like, walking
around catwalks -- caffrey.

141
00:06:58, 030 --> 00:07:00, 500
It's legit.

142
00:07:09, 500 --> 00:07:12, 430
E.R.T. Is going over the alarm
system, but this guy's a pro.

143
00:07:12, 510 --> 00:07:13, 700
Think they'll find any prints? 

144
00:07:13, 730 --> 00:07:14, 750
No.

145
00:07:14, 800 --> 00:07:16, 500
You okay? 

146
00:07:16, 930 --> 00:07:18, 210
Who is that? 

147
00:07:18, 270 --> 00:07:20, 130
I don't know, but hughes
doesn't look happy.

148
00:07:20, 160 --> 00:07:21, 770
O.P.R.'S here.

149
00:07:21, 850 --> 00:07:22, 970
And that explains why.

150
00:07:23, 010 --> 00:07:26, 650
O.P.R."office of
professional responsibility."

151
00:07:26, 730 --> 00:07:28, 420
the police have internal affairs.

152
00:07:28, 470 --> 00:07:30, 270
We have o.P.R.

153
00:07:30, 310 --> 00:07:32, 390
Hughes wants you in the office.

154
00:07:32, 540 --> 00:07:34, 460
Of course he does.

155
00:07:43, 170 --> 00:07:46, 330
Agent burke, this is garrett fowler.

156
00:07:46, 410 --> 00:07:48, 980
- O.P.R.
- Bad news travels fast.

157
00:07:49, 050 --> 00:07:50, 020
Yes, it does.

158
00:07:50, 060 --> 00:07:53, 280
As far as anyone knows, he is
here for a standard review.

159
00:07:53, 320 --> 00:07:55, 160
Yeah, because that line always works.

160
00:07:55, 220 --> 00:07:57, 460
Nobody's gonna buy that bridge today.

161
00:07:57, 530 --> 00:07:58, 670
That's my file.

162
00:07:58, 710 --> 00:08:00, 040
Yes, it is.

163
00:08:00, 110 --> 00:08:02, 310
Impressive work.

164
00:08:03, 120 --> 00:08:05, 540
I wanted to talk to you about the case
that you're currently investigating.

165
00:08:05, 600 --> 00:08:07, 130
The jewelry heist? Why? 

166
00:08:07, 200 --> 00:08:09, 840
Well, the only people that knew that
diamond was gonna be placed in the vault

167
00:08:09, 910 --> 00:08:15, 470
the night before the show were a few key
nypd brass and a handful of fbi agents.

168
00:08:15, 520 --> 00:08:17, 870
You think it's an inside job.

169
00:08:18, 630 --> 00:08:21, 880
And you already have
a suspect, don't you? 

170
00:08:22, 190 --> 00:08:24, 600
You know where neal
caffrey was last night? 

171
00:08:24, 710 --> 00:08:26, 470
Am i being interrogated here? 

172
00:08:26, 510 --> 00:08:28, 010
You're not.

173
00:08:28, 040 --> 00:08:29, 860
Look, this whole thing
is a waste of time.

174
00:08:29, 950 --> 00:08:30, 780
Caffrey didn't do it.

175
00:08:30, 840 --> 00:08:32, 690
He wears an electronic
monitoring anklet.

176
00:08:32, 750 --> 00:08:34, 660
It records everywhere he goes.

177
00:08:34, 730 --> 00:08:35, 930
Just pull it up.

178
00:08:36, 040 --> 00:08:38, 020
- Yeah, we did that.
- And? 

179
00:08:38, 050 --> 00:08:40, 650
And some of the data from caffrey's
anklet is missing for last night.

180
00:08:40, 680 --> 00:08:41, 750
Missing.

181
00:08:41, 800 --> 00:08:42, 790
Went dark for six hours.

182
00:08:42, 810 --> 00:08:44, 090
Well, that's impossible.

183
00:08:44, 140 --> 00:08:45, 450
That anklet can't be tampered with.

184
00:08:45, 480 --> 00:08:50, 010
No, it can't, but... Evidently the database
where the information is stored can be.

185
00:08:50, 060 --> 00:08:52, 250
Someone wiped out six
hours of tracking data.

186
00:08:52, 310 --> 00:08:54, 700
Then i suggest that you lurk
around the u.S.Marshals office, 

187
00:08:54, 730 --> 00:08:57, 110
because they're the people
who monitor that anklet.

188
00:08:57, 170 --> 00:08:59, 410
Caffrey belongs to the bureau.

189
00:08:59, 460 --> 00:09:02, 310
That makes him our problem.

190
00:09:08, 020 --> 00:09:09, 500
Any leads? 

191
00:09:09, 570 --> 00:09:13, 120
This is a short list of suspects
capable of pulling this off.

192
00:09:13, 190 --> 00:09:14, 690
The best ones are already incarcerated.

193
00:09:14, 740 --> 00:09:15, 970
This guy is dead.

194
00:09:16, 020 --> 00:09:18, 730
Okay. List just got shorter.

195
00:09:21, 580 --> 00:09:22, 900
Adrian tulane.

196
00:09:22, 970 --> 00:09:24, 070
This is our prime suspect? 

197
00:09:24, 130 --> 00:09:25, 580
Yeah, it's a top-notch forgery.

198
00:09:25, 620 --> 00:09:28, 250
Not many people are capable
of this kind of work.

199
00:09:28, 430 --> 00:09:29, 850
What about you? 

200
00:09:29, 880 --> 00:09:33, 190
If i were legally allowed within 50
feet of the right equipment, maybe.

201
00:09:33, 770 --> 00:09:35, 850
Tulane's smart... And a showman.

202
00:09:35, 910 --> 00:09:39, 210
Cameras don't scare him, and he has
the facilities to pull this off.

203
00:09:39, 280 --> 00:09:41, 110
It's got his signature all over it.

204
00:09:41, 450 --> 00:09:42, 440
All right.

205
00:09:42, 480 --> 00:09:44, 250
Let's talk to him.

206
00:09:50, 770 --> 00:09:52, 710
What is with you? 

207
00:09:52, 750 --> 00:09:54, 480
You're like a kid on a sugar high.

208
00:09:54, 510 --> 00:09:56, 290
You don't understand.Tulane is a legend.

209
00:09:56, 330 --> 00:09:58, 070
Legend? No, don't oversell him.

210
00:09:58, 100 --> 00:09:59, 980
It's like you meeting eliot ness.

211
00:10:00, 020 --> 00:10:02, 960
Eliot
n--

212
00:10:11, 070 --> 00:10:13, 330
doing a puzzle with your girlfriend, huh? 

213
00:10:13, 420 --> 00:10:16, 140
That's a nice, wholesome family activity.

214
00:10:16, 200 --> 00:10:18, 040
How can i help you, agent... ? 

215
00:10:18, 120 --> 00:10:20, 420
Burke.Fbi.

216
00:10:20, 530 --> 00:10:21, 630
You're tulane? 

217
00:10:21, 660 --> 00:10:23, 270
You know i am.

218
00:10:23, 320 --> 00:10:25, 630
Yeah. I do.

219
00:10:25, 670 --> 00:10:28, 080
I want to ask you a few questions.

220
00:10:28, 300 --> 00:10:31, 880
- Are you familiar with -- the diamond
necklace that was stolen from joyau prieux? 

221
00:10:32, 460 --> 00:10:34, 080
Yeah. That.

222
00:10:34, 130 --> 00:10:38, 200
Whenever something like this happens, i
get a visit from someone like you.

223
00:10:38, 580 --> 00:10:40, 590
That's why i try to be prepared.

224
00:10:40, 670 --> 00:10:44, 700
You'll find plane tickets confirming
i arrived in the country this morning.

225
00:10:44, 790 --> 00:10:48, 900
Oh, and you're gonna love the photos
from my trip to madrid last week.

226
00:10:52, 230 --> 00:10:53, 900
Anything else? 

227
00:10:59, 760 --> 00:11:01, 640
What's that supposed to be? A cloud? 

228
00:11:02, 960 --> 00:11:03, 830
No.

229
00:11:06, 390 --> 00:11:08, 240
I'll be in touch.

230
00:11:09, 500 --> 00:11:09, 960
Stop grinning.

231
00:11:10, 040 --> 00:11:12, 130
What? The guy is slick.

232
00:11:12, 170 --> 00:11:14, 800
Let's hope he's guilty, too.

233
00:11:18, 700 --> 00:11:20, 600
I'm just curious.

234
00:11:20, 670 --> 00:11:23, 190
The, uh, the uffizi job.

235
00:11:23, 250 --> 00:11:25, 160
Did you... ? 

236
00:11:25, 210 --> 00:11:27, 300
Right.Right, right, right.

237
00:11:27, 680 --> 00:11:29, 840
I love your alleged work.

238
00:11:30, 050 --> 00:11:32, 120
Big fan.

239
00:11:38, 840 --> 00:11:40, 260
Ugh, that was a bust.

240
00:11:40, 310 --> 00:11:42, 510
Why are you disappointed? This
is the part you like.

241
00:11:42, 720 --> 00:11:45, 110
Moving the pieces.Solving the puzzle.

242
00:11:45, 140 --> 00:11:47, 470
I am moving the pieces.

243
00:11:47, 690 --> 00:11:50, 280
What were you doing
the night of the heist? 

244
00:11:50, 320 --> 00:11:51, 910
Went over some case files.

245
00:11:51, 960 --> 00:11:52, 930
That's it? 

246
00:11:52, 970 --> 00:11:54, 520
Didn't hang out with anybody? 

247
00:11:54, 560 --> 00:11:56, 100
June? The short guy? 

248
00:11:56, 180 --> 00:11:58, 400
I don't have an alibi.

249
00:11:58, 820 --> 00:11:59, 760
Look, i get it.

250
00:11:59, 790 --> 00:12:02, 540
Inside job, diamond
forgery, o.P.R.'S in town.

251
00:12:02, 580 --> 00:12:04, 640
I'm sure i'm at the top of the list.

252
00:12:07, 980 --> 00:12:10, 090
I am the list, aren't i? 

253
00:12:10, 520 --> 00:12:11, 460
Did you do it? 

254
00:12:11, 540 --> 00:12:12, 780
come on, man.

255
00:12:12, 820 --> 00:12:14, 470
Did you do it? 

256
00:12:14, 680 --> 00:12:16, 410
I didn't do it.

257
00:12:16, 910 --> 00:12:19, 030
I'm telling you the truth, peter.

258
00:12:35, 600 --> 00:12:42, 490
- ***
- Yeah i need you to look in to this

259
00:12:44, 650 --> 00:12:46, 870
It's forged bonds.Some
of caffrey's old work.

260
00:12:46, 940 --> 00:12:50, 800
I need you to look at them under a
polarized light... For a signature.

261
00:12:51, 180 --> 00:12:52, 270
What? Neal's signature? 

262
00:12:52, 370 --> 00:12:55, 850
Yeah, when i arrested caffrey the second
time, he told me he signed the bonds.

263
00:12:55, 880 --> 00:12:58, 290
I want to know if that's
true or if he's bragging.

264
00:12:58, 780 --> 00:13:00, 170
Okay.

265
00:13:02, 250 --> 00:13:05, 470
Is this, uh, related to our fake diamonds? 

266
00:13:06, 440 --> 00:13:08, 210
Let's hope it's not.

267
00:13:15, 090 --> 00:13:16, 990
I appreciate the irony.

268
00:13:17, 080 --> 00:13:19, 750
We're looking into them, and
they're looking into you.

269
00:13:19, 820 --> 00:13:20, 850
Tell me what you got.

270
00:13:20, 910 --> 00:13:24, 300
Okay. I checked into
peter's boss -- hughes.

271
00:13:24, 360 --> 00:13:25, 530
This guy's a legend.

272
00:13:25, 580 --> 00:13:28, 070
Been with the fbi for 25 years.

273
00:13:28, 170 --> 00:13:31, 770
They were forced to make him retire, but
they found a loophole and brought him back.

274
00:13:31, 820 --> 00:13:33, 810
- Skeletons? 
- Nada.

275
00:13:34, 150 --> 00:13:38, 930
And i checked, uh, that agent
ruiz, who handles organized crime.

276
00:13:39, 150 --> 00:13:42, 660
Uh, lots of skeletons there, but
i don't think he's smart enough.

277
00:13:42, 720 --> 00:13:43, 930
No.

278
00:13:44, 070 --> 00:13:46, 140
I checked, uh, jones.

279
00:13:46, 230 --> 00:13:48, 320
Did you know his first name is clinton? 

280
00:13:48, 390 --> 00:13:50, 670
Checked into, uh, lauren.

281
00:13:50, 740 --> 00:13:51, 890
You checked lauren? 

282
00:13:51, 960 --> 00:14:00, 100
You said, "check everybody." then
there's this guy from o.P.R. Fowler.

283
00:14:00, 330 --> 00:14:01, 290
What about him? 

284
00:14:01, 360 --> 00:14:03, 700
Used to work violent
crimes for the bureau.

285
00:14:03, 780 --> 00:14:06, 620
Wife was killed during a
robbery, and he took a year leave.

286
00:14:06, 680 --> 00:14:09, 140
Then he joined o.P.R., and
his files were sealed.

287
00:14:09, 190 --> 00:14:10, 180
Sealed? 

288
00:14:10, 260 --> 00:14:11, 140
Interesting.

289
00:14:11, 210 --> 00:14:13, 650
He showed up awfully
fast after this went down.

290
00:14:13, 870 --> 00:14:14, 760
Have a ring? 

291
00:14:14, 810 --> 00:14:16, 840
No.No ring.

292
00:14:16, 950 --> 00:14:17, 810
Tan line? 

293
00:14:17, 880 --> 00:14:18, 950
No.

294
00:14:19, 040 --> 00:14:20, 990
But that doesn't mean it's not him.

295
00:14:21, 190 --> 00:14:22, 250
I hope not.

296
00:14:22, 300 --> 00:14:25, 390
O.P.R. Is like this
giant, sucking black hole --

297
00:14:25, 460 --> 00:14:28, 600
- accountable only to the d.O.J.
- Department of justice? 

298
00:14:28, 670 --> 00:14:34, 400
Well, d.O.J. Is just a euphemism, of
course, for the military industrial complex.

299
00:14:34, 450 --> 00:14:35, 810
And big oil, right? 

300
00:14:35, 870 --> 00:14:37, 980
Goes without saying.

301
00:14:38, 410 --> 00:14:44, 200
- Um, by the way, that necklace... 
- Yeah.

302
00:14:45, 360 --> 00:14:47, 160
- Did you -- i
didn't take it.

303
00:14:47, 220 --> 00:14:48, 880
- Because if you need
a fence -- moz.Moz.

304
00:14:48, 950 --> 00:14:51, 770
Okay, okay.Got it. I get it.

305
00:14:53, 900 --> 00:14:57, 750
If we can't figure out how he stole it, we
can try to grab him when he goes to fence it.

306
00:14:57, 800 --> 00:15:00, 570
It's a unique piece.It's too
hot for the market right now.

307
00:15:00, 670 --> 00:15:03, 790
Brunei is an interesting angle 'cause
the market there is less rigid... 

308
00:15:05, 760 --> 00:15:08, 500
Yeah, the language barrier can be a
challenge, though, 'cause one time... 

309
00:15:08, 590 --> 00:15:10, 540
Neal caffrey? 

310
00:15:10, 600 --> 00:15:12, 260
You're under arrest.

311
00:15:12, 310 --> 00:15:14, 070
What? 

312
00:15:14, 970 --> 00:15:18, 100
We found the signature "nc"
microprinted on the fake diamond.

313
00:15:18, 190 --> 00:15:20, 870
It matches the signature we found
on the counterfeit bonds he made.

314
00:15:21, 170 --> 00:15:25, 300
See? It's good work, agent burke.

315
00:15:25, 940 --> 00:15:28, 070
- let's go.
- Stop.

316
00:15:29, 760 --> 00:15:31, 780
He's my responsibility.

317
00:15:32, 260 --> 00:15:35, 850
- Peter... 
- Neal... You have the right to remain silent.

318
00:15:36, 290 --> 00:15:37, 710
I didn't do this.

319
00:15:37, 770 --> 00:15:39, 270
Remain silent.

320
00:15:39, 320 --> 00:15:40, 930
Please.

321
00:15:43, 550 --> 00:15:45, 420
All right.Let's go.

322
00:16:31, 910 --> 00:16:33, 090
You let me down, neal.

323
00:16:33, 160 --> 00:16:34, 800
I let you down? 

324
00:16:34, 820 --> 00:16:36, 940
You told fowler to look for my initials.

325
00:16:36, 970 --> 00:16:40, 600
And you told me to look at your bonds
under a polarized light, remember? 

326
00:16:40, 620 --> 00:16:42, 130
Well, guess what.I did.

327
00:16:42, 210 --> 00:16:43, 490
And, yeah, you signed 'em.

328
00:16:43, 660 --> 00:16:45, 650
And you think i'd be stupid
enough to do that again? 

329
00:16:45, 720 --> 00:16:47, 820
I guess you were.

330
00:16:48, 920 --> 00:16:53, 670
The thief is associated with a law
enforcement, your anklet was tampered with, 

331
00:16:53, 730 --> 00:16:56, 410
you have no alibi, and your
initials are on the diamond.

332
00:16:56, 450 --> 00:16:57, 530
What am i supposed to think? ! 

333
00:16:57, 590 --> 00:16:59, 790
- I was set up.
- By who? 

334
00:17:00, 690 --> 00:17:02, 680
I'm working on that.

335
00:17:05, 510 --> 00:17:06, 920
You're not helping things.

336
00:17:08, 030 --> 00:17:09, 260
- Agent burke.
- What? 

337
00:17:09, 330 --> 00:17:10, 860
His lawyer's here.

338
00:17:14, 410 --> 00:17:15, 200
He's a lawyer? 

339
00:17:15, 290 --> 00:17:18, 740
You can check my university
of phoenix online degree.

340
00:17:18, 810 --> 00:17:19, 920
Go, cardinals.

341
00:17:19, 980 --> 00:17:22, 980
Now, if you don't mind, i'd
like to speak to my client... 

342
00:17:23, 230 --> 00:17:25, 300
Alone.

343
00:17:28, 190 --> 00:17:30, 040
I didn't let you down.

344
00:17:37, 470 --> 00:17:38, 770
All right.Any problems? 

345
00:17:38, 830 --> 00:17:40, 640
None.This was genius.

346
00:17:40, 680 --> 00:17:43, 070
I don't know why we didn't
think of this earlier.

347
00:17:44, 640 --> 00:17:46, 910
And here the man is now.

348
00:17:47, 120 --> 00:17:48, 530
- Agent burke.
- Yeah.

349
00:17:48, 570 --> 00:17:50, 280
That was an excellent job yesterday.

350
00:17:50, 360 --> 00:17:51, 890
Appreciate the cooperation.

351
00:17:51, 950 --> 00:17:54, 100
You know, caffrey was a great asset.

352
00:17:54, 180 --> 00:17:55, 550
He did good work for us.

353
00:17:55, 600 --> 00:17:58, 080
That may be, but don't
forget, he's a criminal.

354
00:17:58, 190 --> 00:17:59, 580
Good job.

355
00:18:00, 780 --> 00:18:04, 130
Guys, i want to pull out
the paperwork on, uh, 2b.

356
00:18:04, 700 --> 00:18:06, 290
We have a problem.

357
00:18:06, 370 --> 00:18:10, 710
Caffrey's lawyer just requested
every file the bureau has on him.

358
00:18:10, 810 --> 00:18:13, 200
The judge ordered us to comply.

359
00:18:18, 720 --> 00:18:22, 030
The judge actually raised
his voice to the prosecutor.

360
00:18:22, 110 --> 00:18:25, 720
"open discovery. Turn over every
document the government has on caffrey."

361
00:18:25, 800 --> 00:18:27, 140
they're sending a truck.

362
00:18:27, 230 --> 00:18:28, 290
All right.Did you follow fowler? 

363
00:18:28, 320 --> 00:18:32, 240
Yep.Once the request went through, he
made a pit stop at a local dumpster.

364
00:18:32, 710 --> 00:18:34, 260
He shredded these.

365
00:18:34, 640 --> 00:18:37, 780
I knew it.Thank you, moz.This is perfect.

366
00:18:37, 950 --> 00:18:39, 660
Uh, information on the judge.

367
00:18:43, 250 --> 00:18:44, 340
Wait.

368
00:18:44, 420 --> 00:18:46, 550
He's got a private office not
connected to the federal building... 

369
00:18:46, 630 --> 00:18:48, 390
On mott street.

370
00:18:48, 460 --> 00:18:50, 320
Moz, i need you to liquidate some assets.

371
00:18:50, 370 --> 00:18:51, 360
I need money.

372
00:18:51, 410 --> 00:18:52, 700
Why? 

373
00:18:52, 780 --> 00:18:54, 320
I want you to buy a bakery.

374
00:18:58, 940 --> 00:19:02, 320
So, all the tulane information
checks out.He's eerily clean.

375
00:19:02, 380 --> 00:19:04, 730
Of course he is.What's
neal's lawyer been up to? 

376
00:19:04, 770 --> 00:19:07, 280
Not much.Legally we can't follow him.

377
00:19:07, 710 --> 00:19:09, 470
- Attorney-client
privilege.- Yeah, yeah.

378
00:19:09, 540 --> 00:19:12, 130
So we have no idea what he's doing.

379
00:19:12, 160 --> 00:19:15, 870
Well, we do know he made a large
real-estate purchase in neal's name.

380
00:19:15, 940 --> 00:19:16, 920
What? 

381
00:19:16, 980 --> 00:19:17, 990
He bought a bakery? 

382
00:19:18, 030 --> 00:19:19, 340
That's what it looks like.

383
00:19:19, 390 --> 00:19:20, 380
Why'd he buy a bakery? 

384
00:19:20, 410 --> 00:19:22, 790
We don't know.We don't even know
where the damn thing is located.

385
00:19:22, 850 --> 00:19:24, 800
All we have is a lease
with a redacted address.

386
00:19:24, 860 --> 00:19:25, 970
Attorney-client privileges.

387
00:19:26, 030 --> 00:19:28, 130
Yeah, covers a lot of sins, that one.

388
00:19:28, 250 --> 00:19:29, 610
A bakery.

389
00:20:12, 400 --> 00:20:14, 960
****

390
00:20:28, 420 --> 00:20:29, 820
- Bakery? 
- Done.

391
00:20:29, 900 --> 00:20:31, 790
- Construction.
- Finished.

392
00:20:31, 880 --> 00:20:33, 860
How's the air-conditioning
in the judge's office? 

393
00:20:33, 980 --> 00:20:35, 530
Hmm, broke down this morning.

394
00:20:35, 670 --> 00:20:36, 900
All right.

395
00:20:37, 020 --> 00:20:38, 820
Let's go to court.

396
00:20:40, 040 --> 00:20:41, 190
Hey, you.

397
00:20:41, 800 --> 00:20:42, 460
You got my message.

398
00:20:42, 540 --> 00:20:44, 590
I did.Thank you.

399
00:20:44, 750 --> 00:20:46, 460
I wanted you to have
a familiar face here.

400
00:20:46, 520 --> 00:20:48, 220
Well, i'll take yours anytime.

401
00:20:49, 240 --> 00:20:52, 250
So, uh, are you sure neal did this? 

402
00:20:52, 350 --> 00:20:54, 350
Yeah. I am.

403
00:20:54, 440 --> 00:20:56, 430
Of course, he says he was framed.

404
00:20:56, 560 --> 00:20:57, 540
Maybe he was.

405
00:20:57, 590 --> 00:20:59, 450
Ah, i wish it was true.

406
00:20:59, 790 --> 00:21:00, 660
What's up? 

407
00:21:00, 730 --> 00:21:03, 500
- So, the arraignment's been moved.
- Why? 

408
00:21:03, 540 --> 00:21:05, 740
Neal said he's gonna confess.

409
00:21:05, 840 --> 00:21:07, 350
So i guess you were right.

410
00:21:07, 420 --> 00:21:08, 760
Neal never confesses.

411
00:21:08, 820 --> 00:21:12, 080
Yeah, he said some important people were gonna
be named, and he won't do it in an open court, 

412
00:21:12, 120 --> 00:21:13, 690
so they moved the proceedings.

413
00:21:13, 730 --> 00:21:14, 560
Where? 

414
00:21:14, 620 --> 00:21:16, 820
Judge's chambers around the corner.

415
00:21:17, 280 --> 00:21:18, 500
Honey, i'll call you later, okay? 

416
00:21:18, 630 --> 00:21:20, 440
Uh, get ahold of hughes.

417
00:21:20, 770 --> 00:21:23, 040
Bailiff, would you open a window? 

418
00:21:24, 470 --> 00:21:27, 270
Oh, the heat is stifling in here.

419
00:21:27, 600 --> 00:21:31, 000
Unfortunately, the air-conditioning
is not working today.

420
00:21:32, 480 --> 00:21:34, 960
Thank you.Please, wait outside? 

421
00:21:36, 410 --> 00:21:39, 680
Per your request, mr.Caffrey, the
chambers have been cleared.

422
00:21:39, 770 --> 00:21:40, 980
Thank you, your honor.

423
00:21:41, 050 --> 00:21:45, 290
In accordance with that agreement, you are
now prepared to give a full confession? 

424
00:21:45, 830 --> 00:21:47, 980
I am, your honor.

425
00:21:48, 090 --> 00:21:51, 650
I'll admit i've done a lot of things
in my life that i'm not proud of.

426
00:21:51, 710 --> 00:21:54, 040
No. No, that's not true.

427
00:21:54, 140 --> 00:21:55, 390
I'm proud of most of them.

428
00:21:55, 500 --> 00:21:59, 030
But what i'm about to do
today... This is gonna be good.

429
00:21:59, 360 --> 00:22:01, 830
Judge hickman's
office.Fourth floor.Thank you.

430
00:22:05, 770 --> 00:22:07, 290
Bakery.

431
00:22:07, 380 --> 00:22:09, 140
That son of a bitch bought that bakery.

432
00:22:09, 190 --> 00:22:12, 440
I confess that i did not steal the
diamond necklace from la joyau prieux.

433
00:22:12, 520 --> 00:22:18, 530
I cleared these chambers because you claimed to
have sensitive information vital to this case.

434
00:22:18, 590 --> 00:22:22, 030
If you didn't steal the
diamond, then who did? 

435
00:22:22, 380 --> 00:22:23, 860
I'll let you know.

436
00:22:28, 160 --> 00:22:29, 880
Bailiff! 

437
00:22:56, 070 --> 00:22:58, 370
Somebody jumped out of a
window and ran into a van! 

438
00:23:04, 650 --> 00:23:06, 740
He's not in the van.

439
00:23:16, 930 --> 00:23:18, 430
Get to the city planner's office.

440
00:23:18, 450 --> 00:23:20, 280
Find out where these tunnels lead.

441
00:23:21, 840 --> 00:23:22, 730
Burke! 

442
00:23:22, 780 --> 00:23:24, 240
Caffrey escaped? 

443
00:23:24, 280 --> 00:23:27, 710
Yeah, did a four-story swan dive
onto that awning of the bakery.

444
00:23:27, 770 --> 00:23:29, 460
Who approved moving the arraignment? 

445
00:23:29, 500 --> 00:23:31, 360
The marshals guaranteed
the security of the room.

446
00:23:31, 400 --> 00:23:32, 950
Never assume anything with neal.

447
00:23:32, 990 --> 00:23:35, 890
You know, i've been working my ass off
keeping this kid on the straight and narrow.

448
00:23:35, 950 --> 00:23:38, 340
He's been helping us win
cases -- until you came along.

449
00:23:38, 380 --> 00:23:40, 300
Oh, don't put this on me! 

450
00:23:40, 530 --> 00:23:41, 520
Hey, hey, gentlemen! Gentlemen! 

451
00:23:41, 600 --> 00:23:43, 890
Hey, let's focus on the problem here.

452
00:23:43, 940 --> 00:23:45, 670
What do we know? Did we stop the van? 

453
00:23:45, 720 --> 00:23:48, 050
Yeah.The only person in
the van was the driver.

454
00:23:48, 110 --> 00:23:50, 770
He claims he was hired through
an anonymous internet posting.

455
00:23:50, 820 --> 00:23:53, 580
500 bucks in an envelope to pick
up the van and park it at this spot.

456
00:23:53, 630 --> 00:23:56, 240
Did the van have a floor
panel that was removable? 

457
00:23:56, 370 --> 00:23:57, 530
How'd you know? 

458
00:23:57, 590 --> 00:24:00, 730
Caffrey wasn't in there
for more than a few seconds.

459
00:24:00, 850 --> 00:24:02, 550
He's gone underground.

460
00:24:02, 610 --> 00:24:04, 200
Can we track his anklet? 

461
00:24:04, 280 --> 00:24:06, 190
No, they removed it when we arrested him.

462
00:24:06, 210 --> 00:24:08, 840
Okay.Burke, find
him -- again.

463
00:24:08, 930 --> 00:24:10, 960
I'm not comfortable with agent
burke running this operation.

464
00:24:10, 990 --> 00:24:13, 560
I don't care whether
you're comfortable or not.

465
00:24:13, 650 --> 00:24:16, 010
Burke knows caffrey better than anyone.

466
00:24:16, 040 --> 00:24:17, 880
Now, get to work.

467
00:24:19, 420 --> 00:24:21, 000
All right, burke.What's your plan? 

468
00:24:21, 670 --> 00:24:24, 830
Set up roadblocks, put up wanted posters.

469
00:24:26, 640 --> 00:24:29, 880
So, to accommodate the location, we'll
have to keep the guest list at about 200.

470
00:24:29, 940 --> 00:24:32, 120
yvonne, will you follow
up on the caterer? 

471
00:24:32, 250 --> 00:24:33, 880
It should be beautiful, though.

472
00:24:33, 920 --> 00:24:35, 870
We'll have 10 long tables of 20.

473
00:24:35, 970 --> 00:24:37, 430
it'll be beautiful.

474
00:24:37, 470 --> 00:24:39, 490
This is yvonne.

475
00:24:39, 590 --> 00:24:40, 750
It's for you.

476
00:24:40, 790 --> 00:24:42, 310
On your personal phone? 

477
00:24:43, 920 --> 00:24:45, 550
Burke premiere events.This is elizabeth.

478
00:24:45, 600 --> 00:24:47, 450
- Sorry to bother you at work.
- Neal? 

479
00:24:47, 570 --> 00:24:49, 630
Uh, i'll catch up with you guys.

480
00:24:49, 690 --> 00:24:51, 070
How'd you get this number? 

481
00:24:51, 160 --> 00:24:52, 650
Stupid question.

482
00:24:52, 710 --> 00:24:56, 990
You know, there's half the law enforcement in north
america looking for you right now, including my husband.

483
00:24:57, 100 --> 00:24:59, 320
He'll find me soon
enough.I need your help.

484
00:25:12, 200 --> 00:25:14, 450
Are you okay? 

485
00:25:14, 530 --> 00:25:16, 850
Ah, still haven't found neal.

486
00:25:16, 880 --> 00:25:18, 560
We got a detail outside.

487
00:25:18, 620 --> 00:25:20, 320
Yeah, i saw.

488
00:25:20, 400 --> 00:25:22, 510
As if he'd be careless
enough to come here.

489
00:25:33, 710 --> 00:25:35, 890
Where do you think he did go, el? 

490
00:25:36, 920 --> 00:25:38, 850
Is he in the kitchen? 

491
00:25:41, 380 --> 00:25:42, 730
Neal! 

492
00:25:44, 920 --> 00:25:46, 760
Peter.

493
00:25:50, 380 --> 00:25:53, 180
Of all the places you
could run, you go to my wife.

494
00:25:53, 260 --> 00:25:54, 680
You say that like it's a bad thing.

495
00:25:54, 750 --> 00:25:56, 010
You helped him sneak in.

496
00:25:56, 070 --> 00:25:59, 830
Well, i wouldn't have had to sneak him in if
there weren't those people sitting at our house.

497
00:25:59, 930 --> 00:26:01, 750
You lied to the fbi.

498
00:26:01, 820 --> 00:26:03, 670
Honey, i did not lie to the fbi.

499
00:26:03, 720 --> 00:26:09, 750
There was just a lot of milk and cookies and pleasant, distracting
conversation while neal slipped around the back.

500
00:26:10, 920 --> 00:26:13, 620
I love this.You've turned
my wife into an accomplice.

501
00:26:13, 660 --> 00:26:15, 790
Give me one minute to explain.

502
00:26:26, 230 --> 00:26:27, 990
One minute.

503
00:26:28, 060 --> 00:26:32, 040
You explain what you were thinking when you
did a free fall from the judge's chambers, 

504
00:26:32, 100 --> 00:26:35, 040
while i decide if i
drag you back in chains.

505
00:26:35, 530 --> 00:26:37, 250
- Okay, does that minute start now? 
- Go.

506
00:26:37, 310 --> 00:26:40, 590
I told you, i was set up --
by someone very close to you.

507
00:26:40, 640 --> 00:26:43, 480
I couldn't tell you at first because
i thought it was somebody in the fbi.

508
00:26:43, 520 --> 00:26:45, 420
Now i'm positive it's fowler.

509
00:26:45, 480 --> 00:26:48, 320
- fowler.That's not --
i got 52 seconds left.

510
00:26:48, 520 --> 00:26:51, 220
I've had a little free time
on my hands the past few days.

511
00:26:51, 320 --> 00:26:53, 810
So, i've been putting these together.

512
00:26:54, 320 --> 00:26:58, 400
They're documents fowler shredded
after i requested access to my files.

513
00:26:58, 470 --> 00:27:00, 810
morning, peter.where are you? 

514
00:27:00, 960 --> 00:27:02, 370
Within my two-mile radius.

515
00:27:02, 420 --> 00:27:03, 580
Where are you? 

516
00:27:03, 680 --> 00:27:05, 720
I'm at my dining-room table.

517
00:27:05, 780 --> 00:27:09, 170
Listen, we've got a
suspected jewelry heist.

518
00:27:09, 240 --> 00:27:10, 340
I'm intrigued.

519
00:27:10, 390 --> 00:27:12, 640
Meet me at 14th and 9th in 30.

520
00:27:12, 700 --> 00:27:15, 510
that's le joyau prÃ©cieux.I'm
even more intrigued.

521
00:27:15, 580 --> 00:27:17, 480
The most expensive
boutique in the city.

522
00:27:17, 550 --> 00:27:19, 020
Of course you'd know it.

523
00:27:19, 120 --> 00:27:20, 630
You're gonna love this.

524
00:27:22, 830 --> 00:27:24, 100
I made that call from my home.

525
00:27:24, 140 --> 00:27:25, 540
Yep.

526
00:27:25, 610 --> 00:27:26, 790
My god, they tapped my phone.

527
00:27:26, 840 --> 00:27:29, 520
No. They didn't tap it.That
would require a court order.

528
00:27:29, 580 --> 00:27:31, 430
Look at your phone.

529
00:27:33, 540 --> 00:27:37, 780
It's a bug.Standard bureau
issue.Activates when you pick it up.

530
00:27:39, 990 --> 00:27:42, 480
They've been inside my house.

531
00:27:51, 930 --> 00:27:54, 090
They couldn't have had authorization.

532
00:27:54, 430 --> 00:27:57, 230
Not within the window of the
crime and his suspicion of you.

533
00:27:57, 280 --> 00:27:59, 780
Exactly.Fowler is dirty.

534
00:27:59, 850 --> 00:28:03, 250
Peter, i have access to
every file the fbi has on me.

535
00:28:03, 320 --> 00:28:07, 230
You had jones process a request to
look at my initials on the bond forgery.

536
00:28:07, 310 --> 00:28:11, 180
After you checked the forgery to see if i was
telling the truth, one other person checked it, too.

537
00:28:11, 230 --> 00:28:12, 130
Fowler.

538
00:28:12, 190 --> 00:28:15, 130
And then my initials just happened
to show up on the pink diamond.

539
00:28:15, 180 --> 00:28:17, 860
He's using you to get to me.

540
00:28:19, 310 --> 00:28:20, 870
My minute's up.

541
00:28:29, 650 --> 00:28:33, 320
I said i'd give a full
confession, so here it is.

542
00:28:33, 800 --> 00:28:35, 930
I've been trying to find kate.

543
00:28:36, 550 --> 00:28:38, 230
Am i supposed to look surprised? 

544
00:28:38, 310 --> 00:28:39, 530
Maybe.

545
00:28:40, 260 --> 00:28:42, 710
I talked to her, peter.

546
00:28:48, 190 --> 00:28:50, 040
I'm familiar with this photo.

547
00:28:50, 100 --> 00:28:52, 150
Well, you haven't seen all of it.

548
00:28:53, 980 --> 00:28:55, 740
She's being held by someone.

549
00:28:55, 800 --> 00:28:57, 070
She's too scared to say who.

550
00:28:57, 110 --> 00:29:01, 980
But after our chinatown operation, interpol
told me the man who has kate is with the fbi.

551
00:29:02, 050 --> 00:29:03, 080
You think it's fowler.

552
00:29:03, 130 --> 00:29:04, 300
I do now.

553
00:29:04, 380 --> 00:29:06, 310
What's he want from you? 

554
00:29:06, 360 --> 00:29:08, 430
I don't know.

555
00:29:09, 020 --> 00:29:10, 340
Could be anything.

556
00:29:10, 390 --> 00:29:11, 780
Like what? 

557
00:29:11, 850 --> 00:29:13, 820
No.

558
00:29:13, 930 --> 00:29:15, 280
No, you'd have to arrest me.

559
00:29:15, 340 --> 00:29:16, 780
I should be arresting you right now.

560
00:29:16, 820 --> 00:29:17, 760
But you're not.

561
00:29:17, 820 --> 00:29:19, 020
So give him what he wants.

562
00:29:19, 080 --> 00:29:22, 070
If i do, there's no guarantee
i'll ever see her again.

563
00:29:22, 710 --> 00:29:24, 170
We need to look into fowler.

564
00:29:24, 210 --> 00:29:27, 000
You're asking me to investigate
o.P.R.That's suicide.

565
00:29:27, 070 --> 00:29:29, 900
He's already investigating you.

566
00:29:34, 050 --> 00:29:36, 750
We'd have to go behind
the bureau's back.

567
00:29:37, 350 --> 00:29:39, 470
Not if you clear me first.

568
00:29:40, 710 --> 00:29:43, 110
It's what you do for a living, right? 

569
00:29:44, 170 --> 00:29:46, 070
All right.

570
00:29:47, 370 --> 00:29:48, 820
I'll be in touch.

571
00:29:48, 890 --> 00:29:50, 180
This is untraceable.

572
00:29:50, 230 --> 00:29:53, 650
- But if for any reason you need to get
in touch with me -- don't say another word.

573
00:29:53, 980 --> 00:29:55, 470
I don't want to know where you're going.

574
00:29:55, 520 --> 00:29:57, 270
Plausible deniability? 

575
00:29:57, 340 --> 00:29:58, 970
Words to live by.

576
00:30:00, 100 --> 00:30:01, 160
Peter... 

577
00:30:21, 220 --> 00:30:22, 610
What's the latest? 

578
00:30:22, 690 --> 00:30:24, 010
We've got conflicting intel.

579
00:30:24, 050 --> 00:30:27, 720
I mean, we've got reports of caffrey
sighted everywhere from jersey to geneva.

580
00:30:27, 770 --> 00:30:28, 920
He's covering all his bases.

581
00:30:28, 970 --> 00:30:30, 970
Ah, he stole them right off the field.

582
00:30:31, 020 --> 00:30:32, 570
You got a quick minute? 

583
00:30:32, 630 --> 00:30:34, 170
Yeah.

584
00:30:34, 290 --> 00:30:36, 240
I just wanted to apologize
about the other day, you know? 

585
00:30:36, 290 --> 00:30:38, 050
I mean, we all want what's
best for the bureau, right? 

586
00:30:38, 170 --> 00:30:39, 750
Of course.

587
00:30:39, 830 --> 00:30:41, 970
Hey, and let me ask you a
question.Just hypothetically.

588
00:30:42, 030 --> 00:30:46, 470
If you had to guess, right
now... Where's caffrey? 

589
00:30:48, 110 --> 00:30:51, 750
Probably trying to leave the
country... If he hasn't already.

590
00:30:51, 910 --> 00:30:54, 600
Oh, you don't think
he'd stay in manhattan? 

591
00:30:54, 700 --> 00:30:56, 420
Would there be a reason to? 

592
00:30:56, 460 --> 00:30:58, 060
I don't know.

593
00:30:58, 570 --> 00:31:01, 890
I just want to make sure we're using our
resources as wisely as possible, you know? 

594
00:31:01, 920 --> 00:31:04, 690
Like i said, roadblocks
and wanted posters.

595
00:31:05, 910 --> 00:31:07, 310
That's how we're gonna catch him, huh? 

596
00:31:07, 360 --> 00:31:08, 740
It's a good start.

597
00:31:09, 110 --> 00:31:10, 990
Now, if you don't mind, i
got to get back to work.

598
00:31:11, 050 --> 00:31:12, 820
Oh, yeah.

599
00:31:18, 190 --> 00:31:19, 110
Do me a favor.

600
00:31:19, 290 --> 00:31:20, 310
Jones: yeah, what's up? 

601
00:31:20, 360 --> 00:31:22, 450
Keep an eye on this
fowler guy.And his goons.

602
00:31:22, 510 --> 00:31:23, 450
I'm allowed to do that? 

603
00:31:23, 490 --> 00:31:25, 670
I'm authorizing you to.

604
00:31:25, 690 --> 00:31:27, 770
Something isn't right.

605
00:31:39, 630 --> 00:31:41, 480
Hey, my man.

606
00:31:41, 580 --> 00:31:42, 960
How about you do me a favor? 

607
00:31:43, 010 --> 00:31:44, 220
What's that? 

608
00:31:44, 280 --> 00:31:47, 030
Get the latest photo of
caffrey to massachusetts p.D.

609
00:31:47, 150 --> 00:31:48, 000
Something you can't handle yourself? 

610
00:31:48, 050 --> 00:31:50, 220
Oh, i'm just trying to work together.

611
00:31:50, 670 --> 00:31:52, 250
Right.

612
00:32:02, 560 --> 00:32:05, 150
Meet me at our jewelry
store in 20 minutes.

613
00:32:05, 220 --> 00:32:07, 410
I didn't think i was supposed to
return to the scene of the crime.

614
00:32:07, 460 --> 00:32:11, 200
Let's revisit it and figure out how
you allegedly pulled this all off.

615
00:32:26, 000 --> 00:32:27, 780
Nice disguise, jacko.

616
00:32:27, 840 --> 00:32:29, 910
I never really liked this picture.

617
00:32:29, 980 --> 00:32:31, 920
Oh, it's pretty good for a mug shot.

618
00:32:32, 160 --> 00:32:34, 150
It's better than my
driver's license photo.

619
00:32:34, 190 --> 00:32:35, 750
Which one? You have several.

620
00:32:36, 760 --> 00:32:38, 300
All right.One crime at a time.

621
00:32:38, 360 --> 00:32:39, 790
I want to check out that vault.

622
00:32:39, 840 --> 00:32:41, 940
Yeah, well, i can't exactly walk in.

623
00:32:42, 000 --> 00:32:45, 270
I'm gonna tell them you're in my custody and that
you're gonna show me how you got into the vault.

624
00:32:45, 350 --> 00:32:46, 890
Stealthy.

625
00:32:46, 960 --> 00:32:48, 530
Peter, i'm starting to like you again.

626
00:32:48, 590 --> 00:32:50, 630
Then we're hanging out too much.

627
00:33:06, 180 --> 00:33:12, 260
We assumed... The thief went through
blind spots of the surveillance camera.

628
00:33:13, 260 --> 00:33:17, 540
But forensics says the alarm
was never tampered with.

629
00:33:17, 580 --> 00:33:20, 670
- Well, that's not possible
unless -- he never left the vault.

630
00:33:29, 090 --> 00:33:31, 450
This wasn't flickering
on the security tape.

631
00:33:35, 280 --> 00:33:37, 090
No, it wasn't.

632
00:33:44, 240 --> 00:33:47, 130
Come on.There you go.

633
00:33:52, 460 --> 00:33:53, 840
Nothing.

634
00:33:53, 920 --> 00:33:55, 770
Could be a misdirect here.

635
00:33:56, 390 --> 00:33:57, 630
Let me see.

636
00:34:18, 400 --> 00:34:19, 830
How did the fbi miss this? 

637
00:34:19, 900 --> 00:34:21, 070
We didn't.

638
00:34:21, 120 --> 00:34:24, 240
Fowler had O.P.R. Take
over the investigation.

639
00:34:31, 870 --> 00:34:34, 020
I'll be -- this is an
old prohibition tunnel.

640
00:34:34, 130 --> 00:34:37, 420
- Yeah, well, someone found a new use for it.
- Yeah.

641
00:34:57, 630 --> 00:35:01, 630
I'll call in a team.We'll
start canvassing for witnesses.

642
00:35:03, 600 --> 00:35:05, 420
We may not have to.

643
00:35:06, 810 --> 00:35:09, 750
Who said big brother's a bad thing? 

644
00:35:10, 010 --> 00:35:11, 390
Jones.

645
00:35:11, 450 --> 00:35:14, 690
I'm gonna need you to pull a
video off a surveillance camera.

646
00:35:26, 530 --> 00:35:28, 260
Where's o.P.R.? 

647
00:35:28, 450 --> 00:35:31, 130
I had jones reassign
them to penn station.

648
00:35:31, 190 --> 00:35:32, 780
Jones? How'd he do that? 

649
00:35:32, 810 --> 00:35:34, 940
He does a pretty good fowler.

650
00:35:36, 050 --> 00:35:39, 890
All right, we're coming up to the place
where our masked man enters the vault.

651
00:35:39, 930 --> 00:35:42, 150
Add a few minutes for him to
double back and cover his tracks.

652
00:35:42, 200 --> 00:35:45, 130
Yeah.

653
00:35:45, 610 --> 00:35:47, 850
Is that tulane? 

654
00:35:51, 110 --> 00:35:52, 990
All right, play it at half-speed.

655
00:35:54, 630 --> 00:35:56, 500
That's got to be tulane.

656
00:35:56, 600 --> 00:35:58, 520
Come on. Come on. Turn around.

657
00:36:01, 260 --> 00:36:02, 730
Gotcha.

658
00:36:03, 000 --> 00:36:05, 120
Oh, i guess he never did go to madrid.

659
00:36:05, 190 --> 00:36:07, 650
I knew his plane tickets were fakes.

660
00:36:08, 470 --> 00:36:10, 280
No, you didn't.

661
00:36:10, 560 --> 00:36:16, 970
Guy steals $3.2 million in diamonds, and we
get him because he can't resist a pretty face.

662
00:36:17, 060 --> 00:36:19, 180
Well, it happens to the best of us.

663
00:36:20, 320 --> 00:36:21, 270
What? 

664
00:36:21, 370 --> 00:36:22, 250
You know what.

665
00:36:22, 320 --> 00:36:24, 300
- No, i don't.
- Yes, you do.

666
00:36:29, 180 --> 00:36:30, 510
I see you got my page.

667
00:36:30, 570 --> 00:36:32, 680
You had no business helping
burke disappear like that.

668
00:36:32, 760 --> 00:36:34, 620
Why would agent burke disappear? 

669
00:36:34, 640 --> 00:36:36, 750
You think he was being followed? 

670
00:36:36, 820 --> 00:36:39, 060
You want to bring on a full
o.P.R. Investigation, agent jones? 

671
00:36:39, 130 --> 00:36:41, 610
I can internal review every
perp you ever slapped a cuff on.

672
00:36:41, 640 --> 00:36:43, 840
Well, you can start with the
one in the conference room.

673
00:36:43, 920 --> 00:36:45, 350
That's adrian tulane.

674
00:36:45, 440 --> 00:36:48, 260
Agent burke arrested him this morning
in connection with our jewelry heist.

675
00:36:48, 320 --> 00:36:50, 560
Guess that clears caffrey.

676
00:36:52, 440 --> 00:36:55, 520
How did you know which vault
the diamond would be in? 

677
00:36:56, 140 --> 00:36:57, 530
Silence won't help you.

678
00:36:57, 610 --> 00:37:00, 060
But maybe i can.

679
00:37:00, 160 --> 00:37:04, 280
Tell me everything, and i can talk
to the prosecutor about immunity.

680
00:37:04, 370 --> 00:37:06, 020
Why would you give me immunity? 

681
00:37:06, 090 --> 00:37:09, 420
Well, believe it or not, i don't think
you're the brains behind this operation.

682
00:37:09, 560 --> 00:37:11, 550
Playing on my vanity? 

683
00:37:11, 650 --> 00:37:15, 270
Please, you have some
video that proves nothing.

684
00:37:16, 010 --> 00:37:22, 380
Search warrant helped us find this... In
a townhouse of one of your... puzzle girls.

685
00:37:22, 650 --> 00:37:24, 870
I think that proves something.

686
00:37:25, 230 --> 00:37:28, 150
Well, if you're asking for my expertise, 

687
00:37:28, 200 --> 00:37:32, 670
i can tell you that a crime like
this often has a... benefactor.

688
00:37:32, 740 --> 00:37:38, 180
The entire operation from delivery route
to exit strategy is handed to someone.

689
00:37:38, 250 --> 00:37:40, 680
Tell me something i don't know.

690
00:37:40, 780 --> 00:37:47, 030
Men with privileged information often hire
people with certain skills to do what they can't.

691
00:37:47, 370 --> 00:37:50, 380
Of course, all of this
is just hypothetical.

692
00:37:50, 460 --> 00:37:52, 890
This conversation is not hypothetical.

693
00:37:52, 990 --> 00:37:56, 170
Immunity for a name.

694
00:37:56, 360 --> 00:37:57, 520
Oh, is he the prosecutor? 

695
00:37:57, 550 --> 00:38:00, 360
Immunity for a name! 

696
00:38:01, 580 --> 00:38:04, 450
I would if i could.

697
00:38:05, 990 --> 00:38:11, 040
The more i learn, the more i
think this whole case is a setup.

698
00:38:11, 720 --> 00:38:14, 190
A lot of that seems to be going around.

699
00:38:21, 640 --> 00:38:23, 460
Make a little room.

700
00:38:27, 230 --> 00:38:29, 460
Found this stuck on my home phone.

701
00:38:29, 530 --> 00:38:31, 230
Thought you might have dropped it.

702
00:38:32, 780 --> 00:38:34, 740
I'm not done with this
investigation, burke.

703
00:38:34, 810 --> 00:38:37, 340
Neither am i.

704
00:38:50, 170 --> 00:38:54, 400
I thought that a small
celebration would be appropriate.

705
00:38:54, 470 --> 00:38:56, 890
You really shouldn't drink
champagne out of paper.

706
00:38:56, 980 --> 00:38:58, 850
You will, and you'll like it.

707
00:38:58, 950 --> 00:39:00, 530
It's twofold, really.

708
00:39:00, 600 --> 00:39:01, 530
Twofold? 

709
00:39:01, 590 --> 00:39:03, 200
Yeah, you're off the hook.

710
00:39:03, 330 --> 00:39:07, 290
Mm-hmm, and our jobs are a lot easier
when you run with us, not from us.

711
00:39:07, 340 --> 00:39:08, 390
Hear, hear.

712
00:39:08, 440 --> 00:39:10, 360
I'll drink to that.

713
00:39:13, 100 --> 00:39:14, 210
What about o.P.R.? 

714
00:39:14, 260 --> 00:39:16, 240
They're gone, for now.

715
00:39:16, 310 --> 00:39:19, 660
Celebrate the victories, however
long they last.

716
00:39:19, 770 --> 00:39:20, 940
I'll drink to that.

717
00:39:21, 030 --> 00:39:24, 020
mr.Caffrey? There's a
call for you on line 2.

718
00:39:24, 170 --> 00:39:26, 440
oh, "mr. Caffrey." call on line 2.

719
00:39:26, 480 --> 00:39:27, 560
it's probably my lawyer.

720
00:39:27, 660 --> 00:39:29, 030
You should put him on retainer.

721
00:39:29, 080 --> 00:39:30, 530
I'll expense it.

722
00:39:30, 590 --> 00:39:31, 780
Can i use your phone? 

723
00:39:31, 820 --> 00:39:33, 360
Go ahead.

724
00:39:40, 160 --> 00:39:42, 510
Mozzie, i told you, just
sign the papers for me.

725
00:39:42, 590 --> 00:39:45, 090
Neal, it's me.

726
00:39:45, 160 --> 00:39:47, 150
Kate.

727
00:39:53, 370 --> 00:39:55, 950
- Kate.
- He's close to you Neal

728
00:39:55, 980 --> 00:39:58, 280
Look, i know who he is.He's with the fbi.

729
00:39:58, 330 --> 00:40:00, 100
Then give him what he wants.

730
00:40:00, 160 --> 00:40:01, 900
What does he want? 

731
00:40:02, 000 --> 00:40:03, 330
Tell me, kate.

732
00:40:03, 380 --> 00:40:06, 360
- Kate
- You can't trust anyone

733
00:40:06, 560 --> 00:40:07, 560
Kate? 

734
00:40:18, 240 --> 00:40:20, 410
Hey, i'm just going
through these fbi files.

735
00:40:20, 530 --> 00:40:23, 300
There is a terrifying
amount of information here.

736
00:40:23, 390 --> 00:40:25, 080
How many shots from the knoll? 

737
00:40:25, 120 --> 00:40:26, 160
Let's take a look.

738
00:40:26, 220 --> 00:40:27, 680
Did elvis fake his own death? 

739
00:40:27, 950 --> 00:40:30, 230
Ask the mystery box.

740
00:40:30, 540 --> 00:40:31, 210
What's wrong? 

741
00:40:31, 260 --> 00:40:32, 730
Kate called me.

742
00:40:32, 830 --> 00:40:34, 230
- And? 
- And i can't help her.

743
00:40:34, 270 --> 00:40:36, 160
She won't tell me where she is.

744
00:40:36, 190 --> 00:40:37, 710
I have a theory.

745
00:40:37, 770 --> 00:40:39, 570
- Conspiracy? 
- Of course.

746
00:40:39, 640 --> 00:40:40, 980
Look at this.

747
00:40:41, 030 --> 00:40:42, 560
Fowler's i.D.Number.

748
00:40:42, 620 --> 00:40:44, 380
Over here, a local address.

749
00:40:44, 420 --> 00:40:45, 680
Note the dates.

750
00:40:45, 710 --> 00:40:47, 520
This is from before the diamond heist.

751
00:40:47, 560 --> 00:40:49, 500
Yeah.It's a hotel room.

752
00:40:49, 540 --> 00:40:52, 220
It's not linked to any
operation i can find.

753
00:40:52, 280 --> 00:40:56, 590
Now, if i was inclined to believe in
such things, i'd say it's worth a look.

754
00:40:56, 650 --> 00:40:57, 970
Room 525.

755
00:40:58, 010 --> 00:40:59, 640
thanks, moz.

756
00:41:09, 140 --> 00:41:10, 990
Open the door, fowler! 

757
00:41:11, 520 --> 00:41:12, 870
Kate! 

758
00:41:15, 400 --> 00:41:17, 130
What are you doing here, caffrey? 

759
00:41:17, 380 --> 00:41:19, 050
What's going on? 

760
00:41:19, 130 --> 00:41:20, 830
Who told you about this? Huh? 

761
00:41:20, 880 --> 00:41:22, 430
How do you know about mentor? 

762
00:41:22, 490 --> 00:41:24, 570
Mentor? 

763
00:41:24, 910 --> 00:41:27, 650
What do you think is going on here, huh? 

764
00:41:27, 870 --> 00:41:29, 640
You're busting an operation here.

765
00:41:29, 690 --> 00:41:31, 480
No.No, where is kate? 

766
00:41:31, 790 --> 00:41:34, 140
Kate! Kate? Kate! ! 

767
00:41:34, 320 --> 00:41:35, 480
Kate moreau? 

768
00:41:35, 540 --> 00:41:37, 300
There's no kate here, neal.

769
00:41:38, 050 --> 00:41:39, 490
Kate? ! 

770
00:41:39, 540 --> 00:41:41, 500
You're losing it.

771
00:41:42, 300 --> 00:41:43, 960
You were watching me.

772
00:41:44, 020 --> 00:41:46, 150
Before the jewelry heist.

773
00:41:47, 880 --> 00:41:49, 660
I'm not in new york looking at you, neal.

774
00:41:49, 720 --> 00:41:52, 620
That's a lie.You
recorded my phone calls.

775
00:41:52, 980 --> 00:41:55, 400
No, i didn't bug your phone, neal.

776
00:42:06, 870 --> 00:42:08, 810
Hello, kate.

777
00:42:08, 990 --> 00:42:09, 970
Hello, peter.

778
00:42:15, 480 --> 00:42:17, 350
We need to talk about neal.
